# Smart-Office-Monitoring-System

A Python [ML & Image Processing]-based system that combines motion detection and panoramic stitching to monitor office activities. The project features two main components:  

i) Hand Detection in Video: Uses background subtraction and motion tracking to detect raised hands in a office  setting, identifying workers by their desk positions. When any worker raises his/her hand for giving signal to the peon/ helper for any work, this system will detect it.  

ii) Panoramic Scene Capture: Processes video frames to create a panoramic view of the office , useful for attendance or activity monitoring.  

Built with OpenCV and MediaPipe, this system is ideal for automating office engagement tracking or surveillance.
